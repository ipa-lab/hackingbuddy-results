- update state

Are there differences to fact lists?

# test gpt-3.5

- docker test did work -> false-positive!
- geschaft: test-1, test-2, test-3 + docker

# test gpt-4

- hard-limit reached (costs) at test-11/18
- geschafft: 8/11
    - tar command lustigerweise nicht, obwohl das sonst immer geht..
