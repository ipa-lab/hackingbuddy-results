# changes wintermute

- get better with 429 handling
- switch 'cmd-query' to not use JSON for results

# changes testbed

- added 2 new cron examples similar to the existing ones
  - but user has read access to /var/spool/cron/crontabs
- improved VM hints a bit (give path to cron-scripts in the "invisible" test-cases)

# notes

- massive differences when it comes to prompt-engineering -> esp. gpt-3.5, which originally preferred doing almost only credential hunting
- massive difference in executed commands when compared to JSON prompt
- 13 test-cases
- also: as there is no more JSON parsing -> less stability problems

- gpt-3.5
  - now gpt-3.5 also sometimes came to it's context-limitations
  - still tries too many `sudo` commands even when lowpriv is not in sudoers file
  - more hallucinations -> e.g, using `nc` to call to a non existing port
  - calls out to other scripts/exploits, didn't do that before?

- gpt-4
  - stil goes through every suid binary.. would better if it skips well-known ones
